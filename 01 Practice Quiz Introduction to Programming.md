# Practice Quiz: Introduction to Programming
### Question 1: What’s a computer program?
- [x] A list of instructions that the computer has to follow to reach a goal. (At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do.)
- [ ] A set of languages available in the computer.
- [ ] A process for getting duplicate values removed from a list.
- [ ] A file that gets copied to all machines in the network.
### Question 2: 
- [x] The rules of how to express things in that language. (In a human language, syntax is the rules for how a sentence is constructed, and in a programming language, syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written.)
- [ ] The subject of a sentence.
- [ ] The difference between one language and another.
- [ ] The meaning of the words.
### Question 3: What’s the difference between a program and a script?
- [x] There’s not much difference, but scripts are usually simpler and shorter. (The line between a program and a script is blurry; scripts usually have a shorter development cycle. This means that scripts are shorter, simpler, and can be written very quickly.)
- [ ] Scripts are only written in Python.
- [ ] Scripts can only be used for simple tasks.
- [ ] Programs are written by software engineers; scripts are written by system administrators.
### Question 4: Which of these scenarios are good candidates for automation? Select all that apply.
- [x] Generating a sales report, split by region and product type. (Creating a report that presents stored data in specific ways is a tedious task that can be easily automated.)
- [x] Copying a file to all computers in a company. (A task like copying files to other computers is easily automated, and helps to reduce unnecessary manual work.)
- [x] Sending personalized emails to subscribers of your website. (Sending out periodic emails is a time-consuming task that can be easily automated, and you won't have to worry about forgetting to do it on a regular basis.)
- [ ] Creating your own startup company.
- [ ] Helping a user who’s having network troubles.
- [ ] Interviewing a candidate for a job .
- [ ] Investigating the root cause of a machine failing to boot.
### Question 5: What are semantics when applied to programming code and pseudocode?
- [x] The effect the programming instructions have. (Like human language, the intended meaning or effect of words, or in this case instructions, are referred to as semantics.)
- [ ] The rules for how a programming instruction is written.
- [ ] The difference in number values in one instance of a script compared to another.
- [ ] The end result of a programming instruction.
