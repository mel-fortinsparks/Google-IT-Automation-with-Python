## Strings
### What is a string?
#### Question: 
Modify the double_word function so that it returns the same word repeated twice, followed by the length of the new doubled word. For example, double_word("hello") should return hellohello10.<br>
**Before:**
```
def double_word(word):
    return

print(double_word("hello")) # Should return hellohello10
print(double_word("abc"))   # Should return abcabc6
print(double_word(""))      # Should return 0
```
**After:**
```
def double_word(word):
    return word*2 + str(len(word*2))

print(double_word("hello")) # Should return hellohello10
print(double_word("abc"))   # Should return abcabc6
print(double_word(""))      # Should return 0
```
**Output:**
```
hellohello10
abcabc6
0
```
### The parts of a string
```
name = "Jaylen"
print(name[1])
```
Output:
```
a
```
>The first letter, J, is in the "0" position); Python starts counting indexes from 0, not one.
```
print(name[0])
print(name[5])
```
Output:
```
J
n
```
If you do print(name[6]), it'll give you a traceback error because it is outside of the range of the given string. If you don't know how long a string is, you can use negative indexes instead.
```
text = "Random string with a lot of characters"
print(text[-1])
print(text[-2])
```
Output:
```
s
r
```
#### Question
Want to give it a go yourself? Be my guest! Modify the first_and_last function so that it returns True if the first letter of the string is the same as the last letter of the string, False if theyâ€™re different. Remember that you can access characters using message[0] or message[-1].<br><br>
Be careful how you handle the empty string, which should return True since nothing is equal to nothing.<br>
**Before:**
```
def first_and_last(message):
    return False

print(first_and_last("else"))
print(first_and_last("tree"))
print(first_and_last(""))
```
**After:**
```
def first_and_last(message):
    if message =="":
        return True
    if message[0] == message[-1]:
        return True
    if message[0] != message[-1]:
        return False

print(first_and_last("else"))
print(first_and_last("tree"))
print(first_and_last(""))
```
**Output:**
```
True
False
True
```
