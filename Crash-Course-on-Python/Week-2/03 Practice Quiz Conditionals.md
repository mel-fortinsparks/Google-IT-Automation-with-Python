# Practice Quiz: Conditionals
### Question 1: What's the value of this Python expression: (2**2) == 4?
- [ ]  4
- [ ]  2**2
- [x]  True (The conditional operator == checks if two values are equal. The result of that operation is a boolean: either True or False.)
- [ ]  False
### Question 2: 
**Before:**
```
def greeting(name):
  if ___ == "Taylor":
    return "Welcome back Taylor!"
  ___:
    return "Hello there, " + name

print(greeting("Taylor"))
print(greeting("John"))
```
**After**
```
def greeting(name):
  if name == "Taylor":
    return "Welcome back Taylor!"
  else:
    return "Hello there, " + name

print(greeting("Taylor"))
print(greeting("John"))
```
### Question 3: Whatâ€™s the output of this code if number equals 10?
```
if number > 11: 
  print(0)
elif number != 10:
  print(1)
elif number >= 20 or number < 12:
  print(2)
else:
  print(3)
```
>2

### Question 4: Is "A dog" smaller or larger than "A mouse"? Is 9999+8888 smaller or larger than 100*100? Replace the plus sign in the following code to let Python check it for you and then answer.
```
print("A dog" < "A mouse")
print(9999+8888 > 100*100)
```
- [ ] "A dog" is larger than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is larger than 100x100
- [x] "A dog" is smaller than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is larger than 100x100
- [ ] "A dog" is larger than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is smaller than 100x100
- [ ] "A dog" is smaller than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is smaller than 100x100
### Question 5: Question 5
If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096x2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?
#### Before:
```
def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    full_blocks = ___
    # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    partial_block_remainder = ___
    # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    # to store your data.
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        return ___
    return ___
```
**After:**
```
def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    full_blocks = filesize // block_size
    partial_block_remainder = filesize % block_size
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        return block_size * (full_blocks+1)
    return block_size
```
> print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096 <br>
> print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096 <br>
> print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192 <br>
> print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192 <br>
